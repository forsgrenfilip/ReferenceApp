# ReferenceApp

This is a project that I did whilst restructuring the data used for references at Alimak Sweden.
I was inspired to make an app that could easily generate reference lists based on specific filter criterions.
(a more dynamic way than it previously handeled)

At the time I just recently learned the basics in html, css and javascript.
Hence, I got inspired to create my first web application.

the app can be launched using app.py using flask package in python. there is also some other dependencies that
needs to be installed before demo.
